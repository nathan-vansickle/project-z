# project-z

This is a game that I developed as a freshman in high school using Python 3.6.

The main idea behind the game was inspired by the Choose Your Own Adventure series of books.
I wanted to create a game that would function like one of those books through a text-based interface.
Some main features of the game include the extensive dislogue and combat systems.
